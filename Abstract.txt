	Upon exhaustive research, we've found out that even though apparel department constitutes around 20% share of the e-commerce platform, 2.96%-6.36% of all apparel orders are returned due to fitting problems which arises because of inconsistent fitting standards across the brands. Our software solution 'SnugShopper' aims to bring about the next big leap in apparel sector on e-commerce platform by addressing this very issue. It takes into account of various stakeholders like sellers, customers, senior customers, less tech-savvy peers, delivery chain and environment.
	We approach the challenge by introducing 2 innovative aspects in our solution - fitting analysis with automated feature extraction and virtual trial room using AR (Augmented Reality). Sellers can enlist the product with necessary images and it automatically extracts the measurements nullifying the scope of following disputed standards. Customers can then try them on using AR and can get a visual fitting report before their purchase, coupled with tailored suggestions for enhancing their shopping experience.
	We've chosen Oracle Apex for front-end application development, Python for back-end processing (with the help of libraries and frameworks like Django, OpenCV, Pandas, MediaPipe) and Oracle's relational database for storing data. The full-fledged commercial product will also require AI tools to implement technologies like stable diffusion and GAN.
	We foresee a bright business potential along with significant social impacts like inclusivity, environmental benefits (by reducing carbon footprint), body positivity, sustainable technology, enhanced transparency, attraction and retention of new peer of customers. There exists some challenges with incorporating AI tools optimally, adhering to timeline and educating people about the relevance of the new technology. However, our vision and structured approach will surely lead us to orchestrate the revolution of apparel sector on e-commerce platform.
