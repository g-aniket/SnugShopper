# SnugShopper

Upon exhaustive research, we've discovered that although the apparel department constitutes around 20% of the e-commerce platform's share, 2.96%-6.36% of all apparel orders are returned due to fitting problems. These issues arise from inconsistent fitting standards across brands. Our software solution, SnugShopper, aims to bring about the next big leap in the apparel sector on the e-commerce platform by addressing this very issue. It considers various stakeholders including:

- Sellers
